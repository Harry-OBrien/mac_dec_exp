"""
The Mapping module performs both mapping and map merging. 
Each robot updates its local map, ùìÇùëñ ‚àà M, and the area explored, |ùê∏ùëñ |, using its corresponding sensors.
A map is defined by a four-channel image, where each channel is a binary feature map of the explored space, obstacles, 
observed robot positions, and goal candidates. 
Local maps are merged when robots are within ùëëùë† to provide updates on explored regions.
A global map, M, is generated for centralized training, by combining all robots‚Äô local maps at each timestep.
